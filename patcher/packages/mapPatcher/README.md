## Dependencies
- gzip (if you're on windows try [this](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gzip.htm), but the installers might be a little cooked)
- [PMTiles](https://github.com/protomaps/go-pmtiles/releases/latest) (put executable in the map_tiles directory)

## Config
Well, the program needs to know what cities you want to download and patch in. Gotta configure that. To do so, you can modify `config.js`. Within this file, you need to add `places`. Most of this is self explanatory I want to say. Code (ie the city's main airport code), Name, Description, and Bounding Box. To get a valid bounding box:

1. Go to [bboxfinder.com](https://bboxfinder.com/).
2. Select your city with the tools in the top left.  
  a. For the simplest, just press the rectangle and drag.  
  b. You can have multiple combined shapes and arbitrary polygons. Go fucking wild.
3. Select the text next to 'Box' at the bottom.  
  a. Should look like this: `-79.405575,43.641169,-79.363003,43.663029`
4. Paste that into the `bbox` field for this `place` in your `config.js`.

Additionally, you need to insert the location of your SubwayBuilder install (if on linux, the appimage location, if on windows, the install directory) and you need to specify what operating system you're using (either windows or linux).

There is a sample config file in `config_example.js`. 

This is a valid `config.js`:
```js
const config = {
  "tile-zoom-level": 16, // zoom level for map tiles to download (16 is the max)
  "places": [
    {
      "code": "YWG",
      "name": "Winnipeg",
      "description": "chicago if it was tiny",
      "bbox": [-97.334061,49.766631,-96.958466,49.977059], // -79.454498,43.624458,-79.310818,43.680412
      "population": 850000,
    }
  ],
};

export default config;
```

## Running Scripts
There are many scripts. Great scripts. Wonderful scripts. You don't need to run them all, but you certainly can.

### AHHHHHH I DONT KNOW WHAT IM DOING JUST GIVE ME EVERYTHING PLEASE
> `npm run all`

Will run every script (downloading data, tiles, parsing them, and patching the game.) Make sure you are running it in the patcher directory, not the scripts!

### Download Tiles (REQUIRES PMTILES CLI EXECUTABLE TO BE IN "map_tiles" DIRECTORY)
> `node ./download_tiles.js`

Downloads map tiles for places specified in `config.js` to be served by `pmtiles`. To play the game with map tiles, run `scripts/serve.ps1` or `scripts/serve.sh` from a terminal or file manager.


### Download Data
> `node ./download_data.js`

Takes the array of places within `config.js` and downloads OSM data from the [Overpass API](https://overpass-api.de/).

### Process Data
> `node ./process_data.js`

Processes the previously downloaded data into folders that SubwayBuilder can understand. These will be located in the folder named `processed_data/`. (THIS IS ALSO SOMETHING I REALLY REALLY SHOULD REWRITE)

### Serve Map Tiles
**For Windows**: 
```
cd scripts
.\serve.ps1
```
**For Linux/MacOS(Mac untested)**
```
cd scripts
./serve
```
